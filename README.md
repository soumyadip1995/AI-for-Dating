In 2017, when a journalist asked the co-founder of Tinder how he imagined his dating app in five years’ time, Sean Rad pulled out his smartphone and pretended to have a conversation with the device.

“The Tinder voice might pop up and say, ‘There’s someone down the street that we think you’re going to be attracted to, and she’s also attracted to you, and guess what, she’s free tomorrow night! And we know you both like this indie band, and it’s playing, so would you like us to buy your tickets?’”

And now in 2019 — a little more than 2 years later, the prospect of algorithms finding your perfect match by compiling enormous amounts of data — from age, gender, location, and sexual preferences, to online purchasing history and even Spotify playlists — has become very real.

And Artificial intelligence (AI) is progressively redefining love and making it brutally effective in ways more than one.
